Using Rocky 9.2 "minimal install" (no GUI, command line only) attempting to compile third party 
library that requires static linking.  Build fails with /bin/ld: cannot find -lc.  Have tried 
various methods to install glibc-static, including: 
dnf --enablerepo=crb install glibc-static, 
dnf -y groupinstall "Development Tools", 
dnf config-manager --set-enabled crb, 
dnf repolist --all (which does not list crb), and perhaps other incantations.  
In all incantations get message saying crb not found or available.   Understand that RH doesn't 
include it for security reasons, but is there a way to get perhaps a glibc-static RPM that 
I could install to resolve this issue?

<Sokel> glibc-static is in crb. crb should be readily available for you to enable and use, 
assuming this is a standard install of Rocky Linux 9.2. crb is listed in /etc/yum.repos.d/rocky.repo

Thank you for the reply.  I came across an alternate (but very similar) path that seems 
to have resolved the problem.  Previously "sudo dnf -y --enablerepo=crb install gllibc-static" 
would fail with "crb not found" response (or similar to...), found another site that said to 
use "sudo dnf -y --enablerepo=devel install glibc-static" (same as above, but devel instead of crb), 
and glibc-static installed OK, and the build that was previously failing now succeeds.  
As I mentioned originally, this is a "minimal install" system without a GUI; some sites mentioned 
this library being related to KDE build tools (which probably aren't present on a minimal system), 
which is perhaps why I couldn't access crb.  Also rocky.repo doesn't exist at the path noted, and 
grep crb /etc/yum.repos.d/*.repo returned no results, so perhaps a minimal install isn't "standard".

<Sokel> It sounds like this is a modified installation, because /etc/yum.repos.d/rocky.repo will 
always be the same regardless of the installation performed.

Thank you again.  Roger that concerning rocky.repo.  Will keep this in mind for future reference.
